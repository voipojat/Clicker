A basic multiplayer clicking game

Rules

You get 20 points at the start of the game and one click costs 1 point

You can only click the button if you have positive amount of points

The player can't see the realtime counter

The player wins

* 5 points every 10th click
* 40 points every 100th click
* 250 points every 500th click

You can only get one prize at one click, and if the counter value is divisible by 10 and 500,
the player wins the biggest prize (250)

If the player runs out of points, he can choose to start over and receive the default 20 points
